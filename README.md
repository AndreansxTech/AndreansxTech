## My goals
I like tech and general computer stuff. However I wouldn`t neccessarily want to do typical coding websites etc. I would love to work in network engineering in the future, and I am trying to gain practical experience by performing experience on my physical hardware. You can learn about my journey with my homelab by checking out my <a href="https://github.com/AndreansxTech/Homelab-2025" target="_blank">repository</a> dedicated to it.
