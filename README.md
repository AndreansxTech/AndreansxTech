## What I like
Generally I like tech. Especially networking. I would love to work in network engineering in the future, so I am trying to gain some expereince by expreimenting in my home. Around the September of 2024 I started gaining interest in Homelabs. Figured that I have a big room so I could build one myself. I am hoping to learn more and more by doing practical experiments on my physical hardware. You can learn about my journey with my homelab in my <a href="https://github.com/AndreansxTech/Homelab-2025" target="_blank">repository</a>
