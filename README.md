</br>Currently Im learning C++ 
I really like to draw, however due to a lot of learning I can`t really draw a lot (I have not touched a pencil since the summer break).</b>
But programming in C++ also brings me joy, and a hope for it to be my future job. Most of my free time I spend on studying for school or learning programming.
If you want to contact me you can via Telegram. My name there is @Koliberekart</br>
