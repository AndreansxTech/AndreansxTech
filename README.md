## My interests 
I love (past-tense) to draw. Never liked drawing with colors much, just a paper and a pencil. I like cats and I am a big fan of animated series such as Helluva Boss since it`s pilot dropped on YouTube. I like tech, especially networking which you can learn about below, and various Linux distros. Also I like cars and I listen to a lot of music on Spotify. Additionally I like some physical works like soldering electronics etc. I fixed a couple of Samsung phones, mostly their displays or cameras. I made some ESP32 circuits. I am also a fan of MikroTik hardware.

## My goals
I like tech and general computer stuff. However I wouldn`t neccessarily want to do typical coding websites etc. I would love to work in network engineering in the future, and I am trying to gain practical experience by performing experience on my physical hardware. You can learn about my journey with my homelab by checking out my <a href="https://github.com/AndreansxTech/Homelab-2025" target="_blank">repository</a> dedicated to it.
